I have made all sorts of things!

=== BeyondGate ===
I have never had the pleasure of seeing whatâ€™s hidden behind the gate.
But I have heard tale of the greatest invention ever made is kept there!
I would give anything to see it!

=== LookingKeys ===
I do happen to have one such key in my possession, but you would have to do something for me to get it.
I have been struggling with one of my creations lately.
If you can help me finish it, consider the key yours!
